This is my first application I have developed using Python. It is an SMS app that sends a text at a push of a button. I made this using Twilio. I also used tkinter to create a basic GUI.

I made this application for a local insurance broker to quickly and easily send a preset messages to her potential clients at the click of a button. This program also comes equipped with success and error messages, if they are warranted.
